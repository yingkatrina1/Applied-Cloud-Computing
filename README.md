The zip folder includes: documentation of the project and all PHP files. In this web application, called “The Recipe Hub”, users can create accounts, submit their favorite recipes, rate recipes, and leave comments. The frontend will be built with HTML and CSS, while the backend will use PHP to manage recipe data, including ingredients, instructions, and ratings. A MySQL database will store the recipe details, and users will be able to search, filter, and view recipes. AWS EC2 will host the application, and security groups will be used to secure access and maintain scalability in the infrastructure.
